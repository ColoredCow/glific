# Open Source Support
Glific is an open source project and as such relies on the community and funders for support.

At the same time Glific is built on the top of some excellent open source projects which serve
as the main building blocks for our work. Some of these projects have backing from large companies
(React, Postgres) but many are from small independent developers.

It is in our best interest, that we support these projects so they can continue to thrive and do good.

Initial list of projects that we plan on making a financial contribution before the end of the year

## Projects on the list to be supported
- Elixir - The platform that powers Glific
- Oban - Robust job processing for Elixir
- Absinthe - The GraphQL toolkit for Elixir
- PoW - A robust, modular and extendable user management solution.
